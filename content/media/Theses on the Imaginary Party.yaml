title: "Theses on the Imaginary Party"
summary: " e moral and political signi cance of thought only appears in those rare moments of history where 'Things fall apart; the center cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world;; where 'The best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity;. In these crucial moments, thought ceases to be a marginal a air to political questions. When the whole world lets itself be carried away without thinking by what the many do and believe, those who think  nd themselves exposed, because their refusal to join with others is patent and becomes thus a sort of action."
