title: "An Introduction to the Situationists"
summary: "The Situationist International (1957-1972) was a relatively small yet influential Paris-based group that had its origins in the avant garde artistic tradition. The situationists are best known for their radical politi- cal theory and their influence on the May 1968 student and worker revolts in France."
