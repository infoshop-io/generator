title: "Power and Authority"
summary: "Everyone carries within themselves the germs of this lust for power, and every germ, as we know, because of a basic law of life, necessarily must develop and grow, if only it finds in its environment favourable conditions. These con- ditions in human society are the stupidity, igno- rance, apathy, indifference, and servile habits of the masses - so one may say justly that it is the masses themselves that produce those exploiters, oppressors, despots and executioners of humanity, of whom they are the victims."
