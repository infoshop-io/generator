title: "Accomplices Not Allies - Abolishing the Ally Industrial Complex, An Indigenous Perspective"
summary: "The ally industrial complex has been established by activists whose careers depend on the 'issues' they work to address. These nonprofit capitalists advance their careers off the struggles they ostensibly support. While the exploitation of solidarity and support is nothing new, the commodification and exploitation of allyship is a growing trend in the activism industry.<br /><br />Don't wait around for anyone to proclaim you to be an accomplice, you certainly cannot proclaim it yourself. You just are or you are not. The lines of oppression are already drawn."
