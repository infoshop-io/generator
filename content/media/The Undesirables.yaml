title: "The Undesirables"
summary: "The passing of one generation will be sufficient for making precariousness the most widespread social condition. Thus we, the children of the industrial world, will find ourselves to be increas- ingly useless, in the same position, in fact, as the crowds of undesirables that landed on our shores."
