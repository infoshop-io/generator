title: "Never Work"
summary: "When Guy Debord of the Situationist International graffitied the slogan 'Never Work!' onto the walls of a Parisian street in 1953, he struck a blow in solidarity with the radical current of left communism which locates the wage-labour relation as the central pillar of capitalist relations and therefore the prime lo- cus of attack. It is, of course, a banality that we need to work in order to produce for our basic needs. But what is at question here is the naure of that work, for whom, andto what end? Useful work? Or useless toil?"
