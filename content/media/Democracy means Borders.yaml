title: "Democracy means Borders"
summary: "Democracy presumes a line between participants and outsiders, between legitimate and illegitimate. Only a fraction of the men could
vote in ancient Athens; the Founding Fathers owned slaves. Citizenship still imposes a barrier between included
and excluded, shutting over 10 million undocumented residents out of the decisions that shape their lives."
