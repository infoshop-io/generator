title: "Looking for Color in the Anti-War Movement"
summary: "Seeing racism as a separate, secondary issue is an old problem in the U.S. peace movement, which does not al- ways realize that it must be anti-racist as well as anti-war. Today, with the ‘Permanent War’ becoming all too perma- nent, that realization is all the more crucial. Do people really think the expanding U.S. empire will be stopped by white folks alone?"
