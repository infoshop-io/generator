title: "The Tragedy of Spain"
summary: "In this year we commemorated the uprising of the Spanish people against the Fascist powers, who, in collaboration with the Catholic Church and the military, were preparing the overthrow of the Spanish republic in 1936. This pamphlet deals with the resistance by the independent labour movement led by the CNT-FAI and with the attacks directed against them by, among others, Stalinists, which eventually led to Francoâ€™s army seizing power."
