title: "A Popular Guide to Building a Community Broadcast Station"
summary: "This book demonstrates how to set up a small FM broadcast station for your community. Of all the media and communications technologies, radio is the most accessible. By asserting your right to communicate, you become part of the struggle for free speech, resisting the privatization of yet another public resource--the broacast airwaves."
