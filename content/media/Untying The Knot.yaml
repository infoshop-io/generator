title: "Untying the Knot"
summary: "Feminism, Anarchism, and Organization. The unstructured group has an important role to play in building for change. But at times it can be dominated by informal structures and elites, and it is often prone to internal arguments and insularity. How far, then, should the leaderless principles be taken?"
