title: "A Cyborg Manifesto - Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism"
summary: "In 'A Cyborg Manifesto', Donna Haraway criticizes traditional notions of feminism, particularly its emphasis on identity, rather than affinity. She explores the potential of the cyborg concept in order to construct a postmodern feminism that moves beyond dualisms and the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics."
