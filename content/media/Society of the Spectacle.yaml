title: "Society of the Spectacle"
summary: "Self-emancipation in our time is emancipation from the material bases of an inverted truth. This 'historic mission to establish truth in the world' can be carried out neither by the isolated individual nor by atomized and manipulated masses, but — only and always — by that class which is able to effect the dissolution of all classes, subjecting all power to the disalienating form of a realized democracy — to councils in which practical theory exercises control over itself and surveys its own action. It cannot be carried out, in other words, until individuals are 'directly bound to universal history'; until dialogue has taken up arms to impose its own conditions upon the world."
