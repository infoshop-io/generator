title: "Feminism and Anarchy"
summary: "To its credit, the women’s movements have raised the issue of women’s revolt in terms other than class-struggle ones, class struggle the only historical driving force seen by the Marxists, who have clarified the economic exploitation of women not paid for housework and child-rearing but have not challenged the reproduction of the power male workers wield compared to women workers. Capitalism has an ideological need of this form of social organisation."
