title: "Making Sense of the Situationists"
summary: "The SI [Situationist International] must be counted as a basic reference point for any future revolutionary movement. The SIʼs powerful critique of the revolutionary herself may have degenerated in the period of counter-revolution into a dead-end addiction to navel-gazing; but this cannot obscure the continued necessity of engaging with their arguments. Despite the attention the SI receives, and the attempts over the years by various toss-pots to claim them for modern art or cultural studies, the SI remains in some sense irrecuperable."
