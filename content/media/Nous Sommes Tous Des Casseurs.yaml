title: "Nous Sommes Tous Des Casseurs"
summary: "In March 1994, the French government wanted to give its tender young wage slaves a 20% pay cut. The State must have figured it would be good training for their future careers as exploited human capital. But a funny thing happened on the way to the bank: those vulnerable young workers stood up and told the State to royally (or rather democratically) fuck off. It took a month of demos, protests, and riots, becoming ever bigger, more violent, and out of control, for the government to finally back down."
