title: "Class Struggle during the Gulf War"
summary: "From the very start the Western media has grossly misrepresented these uprisings. The uprising in the South, centred on Basra, was portrayed as a Shia Muslim revolt. Whereas the insurrection in the North was reported as an exclusively Kurdish Nationalist uprising which demanded little more than an autonomous Kurdish region within Iraq. The truth is that the uprisings in both the North and South of Iraq were proletarian insurrections."
