title: "Police are Enemies"
summary: "They come expecting free coffee at my work. The same ones who detain and search my friends; the same ones who beat that girl back in the spring; the same ones who threaten us with prison one day for smoking weed and who will another day speed past us with because they don’t wish to wait for the light. They dress in our attire at a party, listening for important information; they wag their finger or their nightstick when we get out of hand; they help old ladies cross the street; they shoot dead someone who mouthed off to them—who conveniently had something shiny in his hand. They pave the concrete world in video cameras; they speak to me like they are my friend, they give me directions, and they discipline me anytime I stray from their directions. They are our enemy, the police."
