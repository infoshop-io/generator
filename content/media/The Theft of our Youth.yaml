title: "The Theft of our Youth"
summary: "Radical Ideas on the Treatment of Children. When you told your parents you hated school, what they sai was valid: 'that's how life is, deal with it'. The problem is that when they tell you that, they don't want you to change things, they want you to just 'take it.' High school is preparation for the rest of your life, so we must start here. Start at the root. They are teaching you to stand in line, to do worthless work, and to know only what you need to know to work for hte system. We are the next wage slaves and just as some day they must break their chains, so must we. This zine is not to be taken lightly. You can't just hate school because it's hard, you must abolish it because it destroys the natural curiosity of a child."
