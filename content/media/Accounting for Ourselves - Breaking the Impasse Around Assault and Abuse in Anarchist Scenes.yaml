title: "Accounting for Ourselves - Breaking the Impasse Around Assault and Abuse in Anarchist Scenes"
summary: "Sexual assault and abuse continue to plague anarchist scenes. This essay examines the context in which community accountability models emerged and analyzes the pitfalls we’ve encountered in trying to apply them. To move beyond the impasse around sexual violence within our scenes, we’ll need to challenge the idea of community itself and take our resistance in new directions."
