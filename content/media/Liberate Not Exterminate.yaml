title: "Liberate Not Exterminate"
summary: "A Defense of the City. In 'Liberate Not Exterminate', the Curious George Brigade argue that contrary to some anti-civilization assertions, cities can be both environmentally sustainable and free from both the state and capital. Further, the hive of culture and thought that cities uniquely facilitate is very much in line with anarchism."
