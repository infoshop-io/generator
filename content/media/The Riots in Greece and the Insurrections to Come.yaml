title: "The Riots in Greece and the Insurrections to Come"
summary: "Following the police killing of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropolous in downtown Athens, Greece was wracked by weeks of unprecedented rioting. Anarchists and students, supported and often joined by significant swaths of the population, clashed with police, destroyed corporate and government property and occupied government buildings, trade union offices, and media outlets, not to mention universities. This zine contains a timeline, an analysis, and an interview with participants of the riot."
