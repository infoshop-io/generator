title: "The Struggle is Our Inheritance"
summary: "A history of radical Minnesota. Substantive, radical change is only accomplished with a firm understanding of the past, and it is with this in mind that the RNC Welcoming Committee has labored to produce this text. Minnesota has a rich history of radical struggle and, as history does, it informs our movement today. We have powerful examples of the tenacity of the human spirit- in the land we love, and amongst the people we live with and those who came before- and this zine is meant to educate people about that heritage."
