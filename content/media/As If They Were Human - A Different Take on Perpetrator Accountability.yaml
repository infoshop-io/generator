title: "As If They Were Human - A Different Take on Perpetrator Accountability"
summary: "The mainstream portrays perpetrators as hopeless cases, who care about nothing in life other than power and control. While it is certainly clear that those who sexually assault, abuse, or rape others do care quite a bit about power and control, it is disingenuous to declare that those are the only things they care about."
