title: "Anarchist Agitation and Community Building"
summary: "The ideas presented in this essay are not all-encompassing, but are intended as a starting point from which to move the principles of anarchism, and par- ticularly anarchist-communism, out of the theoretical realm and into the reality today of the working-class struggle against the exploitative system of capitalism and the State that defends it."
