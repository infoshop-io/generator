title: "Autonomous Self-Organization and Anarchist Intervention"
summary: "A revolution capable of destroying all domination and eploitation will have to be based on the self-organized struggle of those who suffer domination and exploitation. We are among these exploited an dispossessed individuals, but as anarchists we come to the struggle with more than the need for an immediate improcement of conditions. We also have specific ideas about how the present world functions and desires an reams of a fundamentally different worl. Thus our participation is an intervention aimed towards the revolutionary destruction of this social order and the creation of a new world based precisely on principles of self-organization."
