title: "You Call This Freedom"
summary: "In this pamphlet, Chaz Bufe looks closely at the common belief that the United States is a 'free country,' comparing rhetoric with reality. He considers common conceptions of freedom, why so few 'freedom loving Americans' actually have any understanding of freeom, and why so few have any respect for it. Bufe traces this lack of understanding and lack of respect to the various American institutions of the public. He concludes by examining the nature of freedom, especially aspects of it which are never mentioned in 'the miseducation system' or the corporate media."
