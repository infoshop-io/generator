title: "The Spirit of Revolt"
summary: "This brief and vivid statement of the role of revolution- ary periods in human progress is as fresh as when it first appeared as an article in Le Révolté in Geneva in 1880, - later revised slightly and printed as a pamphlet in French. The part referring specifically to the French Revolution has been omitted."
