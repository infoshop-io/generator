title: "Essentialism and the Problem of Identity Politics"
summary: "Essentialism is the idea that there exists some detectible and objective core quality of particular groups of people that is inherent, eternal, and unalterable; groupings can be categorized according to these qualities of essence, which are based on such problematic criteria as gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, and class. Racism, sexism, classism, and most other forms of historical oppression are ideologies and policies maintained and justi√Äed by essentialism."
