title: "Mutinies, A Historical Reader"
summary: "Despite the media and the respectable leaders of antiwar movements endlessly repeating the lie that US forces withdrew from the Vietnam War due to peaceful protests in the streets of American cities we are not fooled. The US withdrew from Vietnam because itâ€™s military was on the verge of collapse due to widespread desertion, the killing of officers and small-scale mutinies."
