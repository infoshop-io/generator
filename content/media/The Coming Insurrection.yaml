title: "The Coming Insurrection"
summary: "The goal of any insurrection is to become irreversible. It becomes irreversible when youâ€™ve defeated both authority and the need for authority, property and the taste for appropriation, hegemony and the desire for hegemony. That is why the insurrectionary process carries within itself the form of its victory, or that of its defeat. Destruction has never been enough to make things irreversible."
