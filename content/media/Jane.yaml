title: "Jane"
summary: "Documents from Chicago's Clandestine Abortion Service 1968-1973. This collection may not only to be viewed in terms of abortion rights, or even strictly in terms of the quest for women to have control over their bodies, but also in terms of any group of people face-up against the onslaught of modern-day slavery (in all its forms) taking control over their lives. Jane is an inspiration— a beautiful example that battles can be won without begging. Today they can be seen as a bold display of an effective underground organization operating with utter disregard for the letter of the law— women taking their lives into their own hands and taking responsibility for their actions, all the while without asking for anyone’s permission."
