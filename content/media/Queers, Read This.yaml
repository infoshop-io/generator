title: "Queers, Read This"
summary: "QUEERS READ THIS was distributed as a leaflet at the June 1990 Pride march in New York City. The authors define straightness as different from heterosexuality. Straightness is a force in the world and inside each of us that we must purge. Straightness is normality. The norm for queer people is to take oppression lying down. These authors urge us to fight back."
