title: "The New State Repression"
summary: "Today's political repression differs fundamentally from the repression practiced around the world in the past. The most basic difference is on the level of stragy--the general approach of the state, the outlook of the ruling class. Their belief is that insurgency is not an occasional, erratic idiosyncrasy but a constant occurrence--permanent insurgency, which calls for a strategy of permanent repression as the full-time task of the security forces."
