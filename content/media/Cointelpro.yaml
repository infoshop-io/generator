title: "Cointelpro"
summary: "COINTELPRO was the FBI's secret program to undermine the popular upsurge which swept the country during the 1960s. Though the name stands for 'Counterintelligence Program,' the targets were not enemy spies. The FBI set out to eliminate 'radical' political opposition inside the US. When traditional modes of repression (exposure, blatant harassment, and prosecution for political crimes) failed to counter the growing insurgency, and even helped to fuel it, the Bureau took the law into its own hands and secretly used fraud and force to sabotage constutionally prorected political activity."
