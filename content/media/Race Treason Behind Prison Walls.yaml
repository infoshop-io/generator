title: "Race Treason Behind Prison Walls"
summary: "Usually racism is the best tool of the prison officials to control volatile prison populations. The warden and his guards intentionally keep up racial hostilities through rumors and provocation, and. use the racist white prisoners to confine both themselves and others, in return for special privileges and the fleeting feeling that they are ‘helping’ the ‘white race’ maintain control. This is how the system imprisons whites and uses them in their own oppression."
