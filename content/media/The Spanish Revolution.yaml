title: "The Spanish Revolution"
summary: "The following pamphlet is a short introduction to the Spanish revolution of 1936-39. However, to do this it has been necessary to give a brief account of the history of the Spanish labour movement before and after the revolution. Although a large number of books and articles have been written on the history of Spanish anarchism and the revolution, there are no cheap pamphlets available on the subject and it seemed appropriate to publish this work on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the revolution - 1986 - to remedy this situation."
