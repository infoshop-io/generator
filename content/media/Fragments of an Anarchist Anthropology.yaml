title: "Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology"
summary: "Everywhere, anarchism is on the upswing as a political philosophy--everywhere, that is, except the academy. Anarchists repeatedly appeal to anthropologists for ideas about how society might be reorganized on a more egalitarian, less alienating basis. Anthropologists, terrified of being accused of romanticism, by and large respond with silence... But what if they didn't? In this classic piece, David Graeber explores the implications of linking anthropology to anarchism, and sketches the beginnings of a new field."
