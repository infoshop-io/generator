title: "Rapists are Enemies"
summary: "the rapist is not a deviant. Rape is the norm. Rape is not a crime of passion; it is quite possibly passion’s farthest opposite. Passion’s crime par excellence is murder; we murder for hate or for love. Murder is an act that violates the right to life that is promised by governments; its logical conclusion is pure murder, a violence without object. Rape has only its object. Rape’s logical concussion is pure distance. The rapist does not hate or love its object; the rapist only feels distance. At least perverts have their imagination to feel at home with. Rapists are alone even when they are with their thought. They are the saddest creatures to walk this earth."
