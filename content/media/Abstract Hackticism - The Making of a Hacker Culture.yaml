title: "Abstract Hacktivism - The Making of a Hacker Culture"
summary: "In the nineteenth century, the motor replaced the clockwork as the universal model of knowl- edge. In a similar vein, new media technolo- gies are currently replacing the motor as the dominant ‘conceptual technology’ of contem- porary social thought. This development, Otto von Busch and Karl Palmås argue, has yielded new ways of construing politics, activism and innovation."
