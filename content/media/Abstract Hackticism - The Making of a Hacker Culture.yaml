title: "Abstract Hacktivism - The Making of a Hacker Culture"
summary: "In the nineteenth century, the motor replaced the clockwork as the universal model of knowledge. In a similar vein, new media technologies are currently replacing the motor as the dominant ‘conceptual technology’ of contemporary social thought. This development, Otto von Busch and Karl Palmås argue, has yielded new ways of construing politics, activism and innovation."
