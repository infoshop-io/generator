title: "Neither Their War Nor Their Peace"
summary: "Anarchist opposition to war is not a pacifist refusal of violence. Rather it is a refusal of militarism-of that system of social relationships founded on hierarchy, obedience, the dismantling of the individual, the quantified perception of the other that allows for indiscriminate killing and the description of those killed as a body count."
