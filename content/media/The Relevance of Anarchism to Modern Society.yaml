title: "The Relevance of Anarchism to Modern Society"
summary: "In this classic, thoroughly documented pamphlet, the late Sam Dolgoff, lifelong anarchist activist, convincing- ly demonstrates the relevance of the classical anarchist tradition if the face of bourgeois neo-Anarchism, distor- tions by historians, and social complexity, administrative problems, and technological advance. It doubles as a discussion of Anarchist principles, revolutionary pre- conditions, and the problems of post-revolutionary reconstruction and re-organisation."
