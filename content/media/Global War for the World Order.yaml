title: "Global War for the World Order"
summary: "The articles in this pamphlet are all translations of articles originally written in German by the communist group Wildcat and deal with various aspects of the “War on Terror”. Despite the sometimes mediocre translations they are well worth making the effort to read because they are some of the best articles about capitalism’s current war spree available. The essence of the argument that runs through all these articles is that the capitalist world order is in crisis and in desperation the response is war, first against Afghanistan and then Iraq. The “War on Terror” is thus an expression of capitalist weakness not strength."
