title: "The Neoliberal Wars"
summary: "Warfare has significantly changed in the last thirty years. From 1945 until about 1975 most wars were part of the worldwide movement of decolonisation that saw the formation of dozens of new states in Africa and Asia. Since then most wars have been civil wars within the decolonised countries, sometimes continuing directly from the national liberation war as competing factions fought over the prize of the new state as in Angola. While these wars all have their own proximate causes rooted in particular histories certain similarities can be discerned. These essays examine those similarities"
