title: "Work"
summary: "Work eats up our lives. It dominates every aspect of our existence. When weʼre not at the job weʼre travelling to or from it, preparing or recovering from it, trying to forget about it or attempting to escape from it in what is laughably called our ʻleisureʼ time. Work is a truly offensive four-letter word."
