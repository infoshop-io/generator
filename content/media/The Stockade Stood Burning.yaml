title: "The Stockade Stood Burning"
summary: "Rebellion at the Convict Lease in Tennessee's coalfields, 1891-1895. Something happened in Tennessee, something almost unimaginable to the mine owners and politicians of that state. When the companies tried to intimidate their workers by bringing in convict labor to take over their jobs, the workers responded by storming the stockades, freeing the prison- ers, and loading them onto freight trains bound for Nash- ville and Knoxville and places far away...The Tennessee convict war was one of the largest insurrections in American working-class history. And yet, unfolding at exactly the same time as the more publicized labor wars in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and Coeur dâ€™Alene, Idaho, it was largely ignored."
