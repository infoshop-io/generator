title: "We All Want Satisfaction"
summary: "Imagine insurrection being an immediate break from the lives we were told we were supposed to have. Imagine that insurrection is an opportunity for such a break to become permanent. The state wants us to play politics, the economy wants us to play the game of survival; our lives are not games, we need to stop playing now."
