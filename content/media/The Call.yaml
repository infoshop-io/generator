title: "The Call"
summary: "The youth are waiting, day after day. They wait for their time; as do the workers, even the old. They all ways, those who are discontented and who reflect. They are waiting for a force to arise, something they will be part of; a kind of new international that will not make the same mistakes as the previous ones. They wait for a chance to get rid of the past once and for all--for something new to begin. We have begun."
