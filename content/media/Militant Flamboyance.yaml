summary: "A brief history of the stonewall riots and other queer happenings. There is a rich history to celebrate and take pride inâ€”this zine is meant to be a reminder of those moments and individuals that made that history a reality. There is a lot to celebrate, and there is still a lot more to struggle for (and against)."
