title: "Situationists on Anarchism, Marxism, and The Working Class"
summary: "The fact that arms were brought out so quickly in response to the Stalinist provocation says a lot for the Catalonian massesʼ immense capacities for autonomy; but the fact that the order to surrender issued by the anarchist ministers was so quickly obeyed demonstrates how much autonomy for victory they still lacked. Tomorrow again it will be the workersʼ degree of autonomy that will decide our fate."
