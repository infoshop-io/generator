title: "Insurrectionary Anarchism"
summary: "It is the accumulation of 'petty' acts of defiance and refusal that make critical upsurges possible. They are not a substitute for revolution but a necessary condition for it. That is why the insurrectionary moment invariably escalates so rapidly - 'as if from nowhere' - and is why revolutionary elites (the clownish ringmasters of the vanguard) always find themselves hopelessly overtaken."
