title: "Against The Logic of Submission"
summary: "The desire to change the world remains merely an abstract ideal or a political program unless it becomes the will to transform oneâ€™s own life. If joy and wonder, and a beautiful, indomitable existence are what we want, we need to try to achieve this here and now in rebellious defiance against all domination, eradicating the logic of submission from our lives, and our relationships and our revolutionary struggle - for the destruction of politics and the creation of life without measure."
