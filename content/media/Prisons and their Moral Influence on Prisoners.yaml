title: "Prisons and their Moral Influence on Prisoners"
summary: "Kropotkin nowhere so clearly described the evils of the prison sys- tem. It has not been done better by any writer in so brief a com- pass. It does not require an anarchist philosopher to point them out, and save in discussing the remedy he makes no contributions peculiar to anarchist thought. But his remedy is revolutionary, and his indictment is necessary to give it point. Abolish the prisons and treat all offenders as brothers, applying to them where necessary all that medical sci- ence and modern psychology offer to cure anti-social conduct."
