title: "Everyone to the Streets"
summary: "Texts and Communiques from the Greek Uprising. Riots in response to cop murders are not so unusual, but the response to the fatal shooting of Alexis Grigoropolous on 6th December 2008 rapidly rapidly developed into a much wider movement which expressed itself in an incredible variety of activities, from looting shops and attacking police stations to occupying radio stations, and led to a general questioning of many different aspects of capitalist society."
