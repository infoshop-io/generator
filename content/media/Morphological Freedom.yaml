title: "Morphological Freedom"
summary: "Why We Not Just Want It But Need It. The freedom to modify one's body is essential not just to transhumanism, but also to any liberatory society. Without understanding and a say in our own bodies, we are prisoners in them. Consistent radicals reject arbitrary lines between 'enhancement' and 'treatment': there is no objectively ideal body or single direction of progress, rather what matters most is choice and possibilities."
