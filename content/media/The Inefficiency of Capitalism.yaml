title: "The Inefficiency of Capitalism"
summary: "Instead of engaging in the usual moralistic leftist critique of capitalism, this pamphlet tackles the subject head on, on its own turf--economics--and demolishes the common belief that 'capitalism delivers the goods.' Brian Sheppard does this through close consideration of 10 of the most outstanding inefficiencies of capitalism--things such as manufacture of false desires, product duplication, waste of unsold goods, and the inefficiency of hierarchies. Through this analysis, Sheppard shows that, given the labor and resources at hand, capitalism is a horribly wasteful system tha tproduces a piticully small amount of useful goods and services."
